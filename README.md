Platform for buying bitcoins

## Development proposal

At the beginning of the Bitcoin Whitepaper, we have the following title: Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.

As time passes, Bitcoin trading methods become more centralized, exchanges become abusive, almost asking the color of your underwear; It goes without saying that there are data leak scandals and persecution against individuals.

What is left for us mere mortals?

Go back to the roots, find someone trustworthy who provides peer-to-peer (p2p) services.

There are excellent tools like Robosats, Bisq, HodlHodl, etc., that allow you to find people to engage in p2p transactions with you.

But many people lack the confidence to fully embrace p2p and see a series of obstacles. For some who are already deep into the rabbit hole, it might be trivial, but for the average person? They also deserve to enjoy this benefit. It doesn't take much study to realize the amount of money countries are printing, the excessive devaluation of currency. Let's say you continue to earn the same amount annually; your money will be worth 20% less, in the best-case scenario.

**Where am I going with this?**

I want to build a service that makes it possible to buy Bitcoin in a simple and intuitive way for anyone in the world.

**There are many services that do this.**

True, but how many of them are intuitive? Non-abusive?

I spent a week researching platforms, running tests, looking for reviews, reading documentation, understanding the processes of many exchanges. I believe I looked at more than 50 options.

Of these options, the best ones are:

Robosats, Bisq, HodlHodl, Stackfy, LNp2pBot, Spiketospike.

These platforms are incredible, and that could be enough to stop here.

But my goal is to simplify this experience even more.

Imagine Bitcoin as the Linux operating system. Seriously, who wants to use Linux? If not someone who already programs, loves playing with Docker or some quirky program, most people just want to play their CS on their Windows, and there's nothing wrong with that. Typing "cd" multiple times to enter a folder seems like something out of this world for most people (although it's not), but with some dedicated time, things would work wonders!

I think people should learn about Bitcoin, and nonetheless, people should be able to buy it without much knowledge. We use money every day, and not many people understand how digital money works. But how can it be so easy to send money here and there digitally, yet Bitcoin has so many trade-offs?

This is my dilemma.

And a great opportunity.

There are incredible payment integration technologies, such as:

But we need to go further; we are just at the beginning.

**What will be done:**

At this moment, I ask for help from anyone reading this. What is the best way to achieve this?

Submit your suggestions in the **Issues** tab.

Analyzing dozens of platforms, this seems to be a significant challenge since there's always something missing. For instance, sometimes a specific currency is not available, or they don't accept Lightning, and so on...

Perhaps it's an impossible request, akin to equality, freedom, and fraternity. But nothing costs to try; I will do something even if it fails.
